# üîÅ Ice Arena 3v3

## About the 3v3 Tournament

* Our tournament aims to bring fun with a PvP mechanic different from the usual, which is usually more intense with little strategy.
* With our mechanics of damage reduction, cooldown on skill and potion heals, and central buffs with 100% HP/SP heal, PvP becomes less ‚Äúall in‚Äù and more about positioning and strategy.

## Cash Reward

* The Top 3 players will split the cash reward, with <mark style="color:red;">**40% to the top 1 and 30% each to top 2 and top 3**</mark>. Players can participate in the tournament for free, but to win the cash prize, it's necessary to have the tournament ‚Äú**entry**‚Äù, which costs <mark style="color:red;">**10k CP**</mark>.
* <mark style="color:red;">**The 10k**</mark>[ <mark style="color:blue;">**RMT**</mark>](basics/rmt-rules.md) <mark style="color:red;">**fee will be fully (100%) allocated to the tournament prize pool, as well as the tournament entry fee.**</mark>
* If a player without an entry wins in the Top 3, the amount will be split among the other 2 winners.
