# üîÅ Ice Arena 3v3

## About the 3v3 Tournament

* Our tournament aims to bring fun with a PvP mechanic different from the usual, which is usually more intense with little strategy.
* With our mechanics of damage reduction, cooldown on skill and potion heals, and central buffs with 100% HP/SP heal, PvP becomes less ‚Äúall in‚Äù and more about positioning and strategy.

## Cash Reward

* The Top 3 players will split the cash reward, with 40% to the top 1 and 30% each to top 2 and top 3. Players can participate in the tournament for free, but to win the cash prize, it's necessary to have the tournament ‚Äúentry‚Äù, which costs 10k CP.
* The 10k RMT fee will be fully (100%) allocated to the tournament prize pool, as well as the tournament entry fee.
* If a player without an entry wins in the Top 3, the amount will be split among the other 2 winners.

## How to participate

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/123.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p><mark style="color:red;"><strong>To participate, type the command @joinarena</strong></mark></p></figcaption></figure>

* The Tournament will take place **2 days a week** and lasts **1 hour**.
* To enter the queue just use the command **@joinarena**.
* If you entered the queue and need to leave for something else, use **@leavearena**. If your character enters a match and stays AFK, or is proven via reports, it may result in a **BAN**! This includes other accounts (**alts and mains**) from the same computer or IP! Even if they are not related to the event!
* **You must not be in a party** to use the command and enter the queue.
* If you enter the queue and then join a party, you will be automatically removed from the queue!
* **The paid tournament entry will only be sold in the first week of each month** (_to prevent players from buying on the last day if they are in the top_).

## Mechanics

* **Teams are random**, which makes it fairer and prevents "cliques".
* **Damage reduced by 65%.**
* **Healing skills** get **+10 seconds cooldown**.
* **Consumables** get **+15 seconds cooldown**.
* **Winning** a match gives **20 points**, and **losing** will take **15 points**.
* It‚Äôs not allowed to leave the map or teleport out. If you log out during a match, **60 points will be removed** as punishment.
* Every **30 seconds**, a **random set of buffs** is **spawned** in the center of the map, granting various buffs and **healing 100% HP and SP** of everyone in the group that captures it.
* There are **3 buff sets**, and every **30 seconds** one of the sets will **spawn**, each with its own animation and visual effect for identification.
