## **How does the Mission System work?**

Each mission grants **experience**. After clicking **Collect**, all this **EXP** is converted into points in the general progression of the battle pass. As you gain battle levels, you receive rewards based on your account type (Basic/Premium).

Quests labeled as **"Daily"** reset every day at **00:00&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**(Asian time)**</mark>, allowing you to repeat them and earn more **experience**. For example, the **Professional Hunter** mission can be repeated, and you do not need to complete all other missions, such as **Player vs Player**, to progress your pass.
